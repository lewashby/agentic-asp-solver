# There are four companies: c1, c2, c3, and c4

- Company c1 owns 60% of company c2, giving it direct control over c2.
- Company c1 also owns 20% of company c3.
- Company c2 owns 40% of company c3.
- Company c3 owns 51% of company c4, giving it direct control over c4.

I want to know all the pair of companies X, Y where X is different than Y such that X controls Y, given the previous information on stock possessions of companies.

Model a graph coloring problem with 4 nodes and the following edges:
- Node 1 connects to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 2 connects to nodes 1, 3, and 4
- Node 3 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 4 connects to nodes 2 and 3

Find a valid 3-coloring of this graph where adjacent nodes have different colors.
